# My-Android-Project
This is an Android App built to demonstrate the effect of the Connected-Vehicle Program conducted by our department's 
laboratory. This app serves as a user interface, and it imitates the alerting and prompting modules which will be embedded into the vehicles. When there will be other cars or obstacles or walkers or other dangerous signals in front, this module will show the danger on the screen and trigger the alarm sound.
